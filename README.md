## Description
In this assignment, we were concerned with solving 3 problems using a semaphore and an event.
In the first problem we created a simple barrier.
In the second problem we solved a reusable barrier and in the third problem we solved a fibonacci.
The implementation of the simple barrier is located at [simple barrier](https://github.com/Sajmooooon/ppds/tree/02/simpleBarrier) with the reusable barrier located at [reusable barrier](https://github.com/Sajmooooon/ppds/tree/02/barrier)
folder and the fibonacci implementation is located in the fibonacci folder.
