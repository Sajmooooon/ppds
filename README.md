# PPDS 06
Sixth assignment from the PPDS course.

# Description
In this assignment, we implemented a simple problem of a barber shop that has multiple customers coming in, but 
has only one barber, at the same time the barber shop has a limited number of places, so when the capacity is full, the customers
have to come back later.
