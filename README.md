# PPDS 05
Fifth assignment from the PPDS course.

# Description
In this assignment we solved 2 problems. One task deals with the problem of smokers, where our task was to solve
agent not to wait for the resource allocation signaling. 
In the second task we solved the problem of savages, where we had to make all the savages start eating together at the beginning,
and if the pot was empty, one of them would wake up the cook, who would cook the food and the cook would put the portions in the pot. Then
the implementation of multiple cooks had to be resolved. When the savage finds that the pot is empty he wakes up all the cooks who together
cook. After it is cooked, just 1 cook tells the waiting savage that it is cooked.
